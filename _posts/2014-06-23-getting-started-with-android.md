Recently I've been venturing outside of my comfortable Ruby/Rails existence and looking at writing Android code. It's been 5 years since I last touched a line of Java code, my skills with it weren't great then either.

I started out by following the Android track on [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/). Despte my initial scepticism, they're actually pretty good.

I'm going to try and document the challenges I come up against, how I've solved them and how they're relavent to the modern Ruby on Rails developer.
