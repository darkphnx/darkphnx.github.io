# <a name="about"></a> Hi!
I'm Dan, I live on the south coast of the UK. I work at SH:24 as VP of Engineering - we're a health-tech company with a mission to improve access to Sexual and Reproductive Health for all.

I have a passion for bringing people together to achieve a common purpose and produce high quality products that we can be proud of. I have over 7 years of leading and growing software teams to solve real business problems.

I have extensive experience as a software engineer, with 15 years experience working with the Ruby on Rails framework. I also have an interest in cloud native and devops tooling, developing production ready solutions with Kubernetes, terraform, and AWS. Although my main focus is on leadership I still make the time to be involved in engineering work on a regular basis.

Through experience and innovative thinking it is possile to build a strategy to realise immediate impact while enabling long-term success.
